## Installation Instructions

### For Game Websites (itch.io, etc.):
1. Upload the entire contents of this folder to your game hosting platform
2. Set `index.html` as the main file
3. Ensure all assets (CSS, JS, images) are uploaded with the correct folder structure

### For Local Play:
1. Extract all files to a folder on your computer
2. Double-click `index.html` to open in your default browser
3. Alternatively, right-click `index.html` → "Open with" → choose your browser

### For Web Hosting:
1. Upload all files to your web server
2. Maintain the folder structure (assets folder, images, etc.)
3. Access via your domain/subdomain

### Technical Notes:
- The game is built with React and Vite
- All dependencies are bundled - no additional installation required
- Background image (`zombie-car-background.jpg`) should be in the same folder as `index.html`
- Assets folder contains minified CSS and JavaScript

### Troubleshooting:
- If the game doesn't load, check browser console for errors
- Ensure all files were uploaded/extracted properly
- Modern browsers required (Chrome 60+, Firefox 60+, Safari 12+, Edge 79+)
